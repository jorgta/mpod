<p>
MPOD files syntax complies with the STAR File specification.
However some tricks were adopted to adapt the its relatively strict syntax 
to allow for multiple entries still avoiding ambiguousness.
</p><p>
Unlike the crystal structure that is univocally described, 
material properties are not easily defined with one single value.
<br />
For example tensorial properties are described by a matrix of values.
Often the change of properties under changing environment are of interest.
<br />
The value of a property tag is a label.
This label is then used in a <i>_loop</i> structure where the tensorial index and/or changing
experimental conditions (temperature, pressure, â€¦ ) as well as the actual value 
are given.

CIF files are checked for consistency againt one or more dictionaries.<br />
.mpod files are checked agains the 
<a href="/dict/intro" name="material_properties_dictionary">material properties dictionary</a> 
and the 
<a href="http://www.iucr.org/resources/cif/dictionaries/cif_core" target="_blank" name="core_cif">CORE CIF dictionary</a>.
<br />
<a href="http://anbf2.kek.jp/CIF/" target="_blank" name="PyCifRW_home">PyCifRW</a> 
is currently being used to check the syntactical correctness of the .mpod files.
Further automatic checking routines are under development.
